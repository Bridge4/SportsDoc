# Sports Doc
Created by Enrico Blackwell, Willem Scott, Sayed Abdulmohsen Alhashemi, Evan Swett, Julian Abam

We have all the code in the `coderzz/` folder

When running/building the app, `cd coderzz/` before anything else then standard node app procedure: `npm i`, `npm build`, then `node server.js`

To gather data for the database, the scripts are found in `database/`, each sport has its own data gather file. 
These are just run as standard Python. See schematic.pgsql for the layout of our database, reasonably close to what it actually is serving.
